"""Backends process circuits and (optionally) return results in qoqo.

Backends process the circuit in order to execute it. This can be either sending the circuit
to an appropriate external simulator or running it on hardware.
The backends class for backend xyz relies heavily on the xyz interface of the operations
and is usually only a thin wrapper that takes care of initializing the backend
and applying global backend instructions.
