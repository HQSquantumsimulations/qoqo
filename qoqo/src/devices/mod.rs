/// Devices in qoqo have two use cases:
///
/// * Abstract devices: Contain abstract information for the model of a quantum computer and its parameters.
///     They can be used to determine which Operations are available on a specific device model.
///     A typical example are abstract linear chains of square lattices in which two-qubit operations are only
///     available between neighbouring qubits.  
///
///     The abstract devices can also encode a noise model. Q/// Qoqo devicesoqo noise models are in general based on a (pseudo) time
///     needed to execute a quantum operation and Lindblad rates for the qubits in the device.
///     Specifically in the noise model each qubit undergoes a continuous Lindblad-type decoherence time evolution:
///
///     math::
///     \frac{d}{dt}\rho = \sum_{i,j=0}^{2} M_{i,j} L_{i} \rho L_{j}^{\dagger} - \frac{1}{2} \{ L_{j}^{\dagger} L_i, \rho \} \\\\
///         L_0 = \sigma^{+} \\\\
///         L_1 = \sigma^{-} \\\\
///         L_3 = \sigma^{z}
///     $$
///     Note that as long as gate times and decoherence rates are scaled inversely any kind of units can be used,
///     but we recommend using nanoseconds and inverse nanosecconds as units for gate times and decoherence rates.
///
///
/// * Actual hardware devices: These devices are provided by roqoqo backends and contain the necessary information for
///     accessing the quantum computing hardware. The devices also encode a connectivity model.
///
/// The devices were introduced after qoqo 1.0.0, but their design may be refactored later for backwards compatibility
