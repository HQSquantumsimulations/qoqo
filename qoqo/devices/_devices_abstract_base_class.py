"""Abstract Base Class for all Devices used in qoqo interfaces and backends"""

class DeviceBaseClass(abc.ABC):
    r"""Base Class for all devices (quantum hardware) used in qoqo interfaces and backends.

    The class is based on the networkx (imported as nx) Python graph library
    https://networkx.github.io/

    The device itself is represented as a Directed Multi Graph G.

    The edges are the physical qubits, the decoherence rates
    (dephasing_rate, damping_rate, depolarisation_rate) are node attributes in the graph accessible
    via
    dephasing_rates = nx.get_node_attributs(G, 'dephasing_rate')

    Each PHYSICAL available gate operation is represented as a graph on the nodes.
    This graph is part of the Multi Graph with the name of the gate operation as the key.

    For single-qubit states the graph consists of self loops.
    Each edge has attributes, mainly gate_time (the time the gate needs to execute) and
    overrotation, a dictionary defining which gate variables duffer from static and
    statistic overrotation.
    Take for example a two qubit system with different dephasing times on both
    qubits and a static overrotation in the rotation angle 'theta' of the RotateZ gates.
    In this case we could build the corresponding device graph as:

    .. code-block:: python

        qubits=[0,1]
        dephasing_rates={0: 1/30e-6, 1: 1/20e-6}
        G = nx.MultiDiGraph()
        G.add_node(0, dephasing_rate = dephasing_rates[0])
        G.add_node(1, dephasing_rate = dephasing_rates[1])
        G.add_edge(0,0,key='RotateZ',
                gate_time=50e-9,
                overrotation={
                    'theta':{
                        'static':{
                            'mean': 0,
                            'var': 0.01
                        }}})
        G.has_edge(0,0,key='RotateZ')
        G.has_edge(0,1,key='RotateZ')
        G.edges(0,0,'RotateZ')

    And if we add a two-qubit controlled Z gate without overrotations

    .. code-block:: python

        G.add_edge(0,1,key='ControlledPauliZ',
                gate_time='150e-9'
                )

    MeasureQubit gates are special and have no overrotation property.
    Instead they have a measurement error attribute, giving the probability
    to measure the real state 0 as 1 and the probability to measure 1 as 0.

    .. code-block:: python

        G.add_edge(0,0,key='MeasureQubit',
                gate_time='50e-9',
                measurement_error={
                    'prob_0_as_1' : 0.01,
                    'prob_1_as_0' : 0.01
                }
            )

    To determine which qubits are connected by universal two-qubit gates (and can be swapped),
    devices provides a simpler connectivity graph (an undirected Graph) that has the qubits
    as nodes and the all universal two-qubit connections as edges.

    The following properties are available for all devices:
        - overrotations, dephasing_rates, damping_rates, depolarising_rates: dictionaries
            returning the relevant information
        - number_qubits: the number of qubits in the device, regardless of connectivity
        - available_gates: all of the gates (one- and two-qubit gates) that are available on
            the hardware (device)
        - available_one_qubit_gates, available_two_qubit_gates
        - device_graph, connectivity_graph: multi DiGraph and simple graph (respectively)
            representing the device
        - depolarisation_from_t1_t2, dephasing_from_t1_t2: depolarisation and dephasing rates
            (respectively), calculated from t1 and t2 times taken from the hardware
        - to_qonfig: devices can be serialised with the HQS Qonfig package
