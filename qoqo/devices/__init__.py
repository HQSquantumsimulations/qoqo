"""The Devices class provides hardware devices in qoqo.

In qoqo, device classes define all relevant properties of a quantum hardware device
which is either used as a backend itself or that is simulated.

The information is contained in a networkx directed MultiGraph and includes the topology
of the device (which qubits can be coupled by which gates) as well as physical
characteristics (gate times, decoherence rates, overrotations).
For specific devices, see the qoqo interfaces.
