        Returns a dictionary where a key is composed by the name and the size

class Operation:
    """
    Operations are the atomic instructions in any quantum program that can be represented by qoqo.

    Operations can be of various kinds: Definitions, GateOperations, PRAGMAs or measurement Operations.

    Operations:
        Definition operations define the classical registers and variables in the Circuit.
        GateOperations are single-, two- or multi-qubit gate operations that act on a set of qubits
        and can be executed on a quantum computing device.
        PRAGMAs are operations that can be used when running a simulation of a quantum computing program.
        Measurement Operations are operations that perform a measurement either on a quantum computing device (MeasuareQubit)
        or on a simulation of a quantum computing program (PRAGMA measurement operations).
