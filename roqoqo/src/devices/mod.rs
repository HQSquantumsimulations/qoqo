//! Traits defining the standard functions for roqoqo devices.
//!
//! Devices in roqoqo have two use cases:
//!
//! * Abstract devices: Contain abstract information for the model of a quantum computer and its parameters.
//!     They can be used to determine which Operations are available on a specific device model.
//!     A typical example are abstract linear chains of square lattices in which two-qubit operations are only
//!     available between neighbouring qubits.  
//!
//!     The abstract devices can also encode a noise model. Roqoqo noise models are in general based on a (pseudo) time
//!     needed to execute a quantum operation and Lindblad rates for the qubits in the device.
//!     
//!     Note that as long as gate times and decoherence rates are scaled inversely any kind of units can be used,
//!     but we recommend using nanoseconds and inverse nanosecconds as units for gate times and decoherence rates.
//!
//!     Specifically in the noise model each qubit undergoes a continuous Lindblad-type decoherence time evolution.
//!
//! * Actual hardware devices: These devices are provided by roqoqo backends and contain the necessary information for
//!     accessing the quantum computing hardware. The devices also encode a connectivity model
//!
