//! Traits defining the standard form of roqoqo backends.
//!
//! roqoqo can be used to implement interfaces and backends to quantum hardware, quantum simulators and other software packages.
//! While roqoqo does not require a certain design for general interfaces or backends,
//! roqoqo::backends provides a trait for implementing backends that produce measurement results which can be evaluated to
//! expectation values.
//! This trait is supposed to be implemented for backends connecting to quantum simulators or to real quantum hardware devices.
//!
//! Note: The following backends are implemented in roqoqo and supported by HQS Quantum Simulations GmbH.
//!
//! Evaluated backends:
//! * `aqt`, ( <https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/qoqo_aqt> ),
//! * `mock` ( <https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/qoqo_mock> ),
//! * `quest` ( <https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/qoqo-quest> ).
//!
//! Other backends:
//! * `qasm` ( <https://github.com/HQSquantumsimulations/qoqo_qasm> ).
