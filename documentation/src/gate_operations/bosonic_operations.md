## BeamSplitter
The 2-mode beam splitter which splits a beam with a transmission amplitude cos(θ) and a reflection amplitude exp(i * φ) * sin(θ).

## PhaseDisplacement
The single-mode phase-displacement gate with variable magnitude and phase.

## PhaseShift
The single-mode phase-shift gate with variable phase, given by R(θ) = exp(i * θ * 𝑁̂).

## PhotonDetection
The photon number-resolving detector measurement for bosons.

## Squeezing
The single-mode squeezing gate with tunable squeezing.
