# Bosonic operations
The bosonic operations manipulate the quantum state of harmonic oscillator modes. They include single-mode gates‚Äîsuch as squeezing (altering quadrature uncertainties), phase displacement and phase shift (rotating states in phase space)‚Äîand a two-mode beam splitter (mixing states between modes). Additionally, a photon detection measurement operation is provided for resolving mode occupancy, enabling state readout at the single-photon level.


## BeamSplitter
The 2-mode beam splitter which splits a beam with a transmission amplitude cos(Œ∏) and a reflection amplitude exp(i * œÜ) * sin(Œ∏).

## PhaseDisplacement
The single-mode phase-displacement gate with variable magnitude and phase.

## PhaseShift
The single-mode phase-shift gate with variable phase, given by R(Œ∏) = exp(i * Œ∏ * ùëÅÃÇ).

## PhotonDetection
The photon number-resolving detector measurement for bosons.

## Squeezing
The single-mode squeezing gate with tunable squeezing.
